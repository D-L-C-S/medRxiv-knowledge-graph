# 🧠 medRxiv Knowledge Graph

A powerful pipeline for constructing **knowledge graphs from medRxiv abstracts** using NLP and relation extraction techniques. Explore connections between biomedical entities such as drugs, diseases, proteins, and more.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

The pipeline extracts entities and relations from medRxiv abstracts and constructs a structured knowledge graph. The goal is to help researchers **visualize and explore relationships** in biomedical literature.

### Key Steps:

1. **Data Collection** – Download and clean medRxiv abstracts
2. **Entity Extraction** – Identify biomedical entities (drugs, diseases, proteins, etc.) using NLP
3. **Relation Extraction** – Identify candidate relationships between entities within sentences
4. **Graph Construction** – Convert entities and relations into a structured knowledge graph
5. **Visualization** – Explore the graph interactively with PyVis or export for analysis in Neo4j or CSV
6. **Export Results** – Save nodes and edges for downstream tasks

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Data Collection

Run `1_data_collection.ipynb` to fetch abstracts from medRxiv and store them in `data/abstracts_raw.json`.

### 2. Relation Extraction

Run `2_relation_extraction.ipynb` to identify relations between entities in sentences. Outputs are saved in `data/relations.csv`.

### 3. Graph Construction

Run `3_graph_construction.ipynb` to convert entities and relations into a network graph.

### 4. Export Results

Run `4_export_results.ipynb` to save the graph nodes and edges for downstream analysis or Neo4j import.
